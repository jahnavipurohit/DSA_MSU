# LAB 1 - Introduction to Algorithms and Array Operations

This lab contains foundational problems and programs for understanding algorithmic concepts, asymptotic analysis, and array operations in C. Each part is documented and implemented as per the requirements of the DSA course at MSU.

### Part A: Algorithm Analysis
[`algorithm_analysis.md`](./algorithm_analysis.md)  
  
---

### Part B: Asymptotic Analysis
[`asymptotic_analysis.md`](./asymptotic_analysis.md)  
  
---

### Part C: Array Operations in C
[`array_operations.c`](./array_operations.c)  
  A C program that performs the following operations on arrays:
  - Traverse an array
  - Find array length
  - Search an element
  - Find the largest and smallest element
  - Insert at a given position
  - Delete from a given position
  - Linear search

### Part D: Application-Based Problem â€“ Leader Elements
[`leader_elements.c`](./leader_elements.c)  
  C program to find all "leader" elements in an array. An element is a leader if it is greater than all elements to its right.
